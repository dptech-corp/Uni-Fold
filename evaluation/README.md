# Evaluation of Uni-Fold

Uni-Fold is evaluated on recently released Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures. This folder contains the ID of the evaluation set.

[monomer_list.json](./monomer_list.json) contains the IDs of 876 (301 unique) chains we used to evaluate Uni-Fold Monomer. Chains with identical sequences yet (slightly) different structures are grouped together. [multimer_list.json](./multimer_list.json) contains the PDB-IDs of 162 assemblies we used to evaluate Uni-Fold Multimer.
